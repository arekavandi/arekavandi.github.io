This paper presents a novel approach for Image steganography based on Integer Wavelet Transform. In this method, the cover image is mapped to a specific frequency domain. Then in the obtained frequency domain, edge coefficients are classified based on their MSBs. The suggested method prevents changes in MSB in a way that receiver can extract the information without any mistakes. Considering the preformed classification, secret bits will be embedded in the frequency coefficients and then with the use of inverse transformation, stego image will be obtained. The most important features that our work obtained are good adaptation with human vision system and retrieval of data without error. Simulation results show that our proposed method has a good adaptation with human vision system (HVS) and outperforms in terms of PSPNR factors over recently published works.
