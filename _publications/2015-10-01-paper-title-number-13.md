Dictionary learning methods have been extensively used in different types of image andsignal processing tasks.  In a number of applications, the collected data/signal may havea  multi-subspace  structure  and  be  perturbed  with  outliers.   These  motivate  the  use  ofrobust and block-sparse signal representations.  In this paper, a new algorithm for learn-ing a block-structured dictionary in the presence of outliers is proposed.  It is based on α−divergence and has the advantage of tolerating the presence of outliers.  A block co-ordinate descent approach is adopted to obtain simple closed-form solutions for both thesparse coding and dictionary update stages.  Finally, experimental results illustrating thesuperiority of the proposed method over some state-of-the-art dictionary learning meth-ods, are provided.
