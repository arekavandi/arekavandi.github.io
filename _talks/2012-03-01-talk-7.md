In this talk, I introduced Active Inference Theory, a mathematical framework that describes how self-organizing systems learn from and interact with their environment. I explained the concept of surprise functions, how they are typically defined, and why they cannot be minimized directly. Instead, I discussed how Variational Free Energy—an upper bound on surprise—can be minimized as a practical alternative. I also covered Expected Free Energy and demonstrated, through examples, how planning can be understood within the Active Inference framework.
