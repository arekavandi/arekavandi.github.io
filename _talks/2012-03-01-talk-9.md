In this talk, I began with maximum-likelihood–based parameter estimation for generalized linear models (GLMs) and discussed the robustness aspects of this approach. I then introduced α-divergence and showed how the estimation method can be extended using this robust measure. Finally, classical detectors were extended by incorporating this new estimation framework.
