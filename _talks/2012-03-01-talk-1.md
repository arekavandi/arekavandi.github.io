In this talk, I discussed the challenges of maximum likelihood-based estimators in facing contaminations and outliers. Several metrics were introduced for performance evaluation of a robust estimation method and finally, the well-known robust estimators such as the Huber estimator, Hample estimator, etc. were analyzed with respect to these metrics.
