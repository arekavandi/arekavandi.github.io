I am  currently a Research Fellow in AI-human Teams for Cybersecurity within the School of Computing and Information Systems at [The University of Melbourne](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/). Prior to this role, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at [The University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/schools/physics-mathematics-computing/department-of-computer-science-and-software-engineering) from 2021 to 2023. My primary area of research centers around robust learning and estimation, encompassing experience in a variety of projects, including but not limited to developing Visual Positioning Systems, Small Object Detection, Suicide Prediction, and Diffusion Models. 

I had the opportunity to be a Visiting Researcher at Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, at [The University of Oxford](https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/), where I contributed to brain comparative analysis model for joint species analysis. I was akso a Visiting Researcher at the School of Mathematics and Statistics at [The University of Melbourne](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/), where I was involved in developing Statistical Signal Processing techniques for electronic systems.

I received my PhD from The University of Melbourne, at [EEE](https://electrical.eng.unimelb.edu.au/) departmet where my research focused on the application of robust signal and image processing techniques in the realm of brain activity detection  ([Thesis](https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/items/b416654e-6339-5299-93fb-98aebcb3f30f)) under the supervision of [Prof. Robin J. Evans](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/14757-robin-evans) and [A/Prof. Karim Seghouane](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/470194-karim-seghouane). Notable achievements during my doctoral studies include the development of innovative signal processing methods for Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), Robust Detectors, Sparse Dictionary Learning (SDL), and Subspace Tracking Systems.
I received my MSc and BSc degrees from [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en) and [KN Toosi University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en) both in electrical and electronic engineering.
