I am  currently a Research Fellow in AI-human Teams for Cybersecurity within the School of Computing and Information Systems at The University of Melbourne. Prior to this role, I held the position of Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at the University of Western Australia from 2021 to 2023. My primary area of expertise centers around robust learning and estimation, encompassing experience in a variety of projects, including but not limited to developing Visual Positioning Systems, Small Object Detectors, Suicide Prediction Models, and Diffusion Models. 

Furthermore, I have enriched my research background through my roles as a Visiting Researcher at the University of Oxford, where I contributed to brain comparative analysis model for multiple species, and as a Visiting Researcher at the School of Mathematics and Statistics at The University of Melbourne, where I was involved in developing Statistical Signal Processing techniques.

I received my PhD from The University of Melbourne where my research focused on the application of robust signal and image processing techniques in the realm of brain activity detection  ([Thesis](https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/items/b416654e-6339-5299-93fb-98aebcb3f30f)) under the supervision of [Prof. Robin J. Evans](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/14757-robin-evans) and [A/Prof. Karim Seghouane](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/470194-karim-seghouane). Notable achievements during my doctoral studies include the development of innovative signal processing methods for Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), Robust Detectors, Sparse Dictionary Learning (SDL), and Subspace Tracking Systems.
I received my MSc and BSc degrees from [Tehran Polytechnique](https://aut.ac.ir/en) and [KN Toosi](https://aut.ac.ir/en) univesities of technnology both in electrical and electronic engineering.
