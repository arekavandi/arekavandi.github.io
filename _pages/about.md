I am  currently a Research Fellow at the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, the University of Western Australia working with [Prof. Mohammed Bennamoun](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/mohammed-bennamoun) and  [Prof. Farid Boussaid](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/farid-boussaid) on several ML/DL projects including Visual Positioning Systems, Small Object Detection, Suicide Prediction, etc. Moreover, I was a Visiting Researcher at University of Oxford working with [Prof. Saad Jbabdi](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/saad-jbabdi) on brain comparative analysis and a Visiting Researcher at The University of Melbourne working with [A/Prof. Karim Seghouane](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/470194-karim-seghouane) on Bayesian visual Positiong systems. 

I received my PhD from The University of Melbourne in the area of robust signal and image processing, applicble to brain activity detection ([Thesis](https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/items/b416654e-6339-5299-93fb-98aebcb3f30f)) under the supervision of [Prof. Robin J. Evans](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/14757-robin-evans) and [A/Prof. Karim Seghouane](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/470194-karim-seghouane). I have also been involved in developing new signal processing methods for Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), Sparse Dictionary Learning (SDL), and Subspace Tracking Systems. 
I received my MSc and BSc degrees from [Tehran Polytechnique](https://aut.ac.ir/en) and [KN Toosi](https://aut.ac.ir/en) univesities of technnology both in electrical and electronic engineering.
